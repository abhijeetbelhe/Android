Hi,

If you are not looking for "Testing Web Application on Android using Android Driver" then this project might be of no help to you.

This is a skeleton test framework built on Eclipse (Version 3.7) and Selenium Server Standalone (Version 2.15.0).

Requirement to execute this:  Eclipse (version 3.7), JUnit, selenium-server-standalone-2.15.0.jar and of course Android SDK.

Thanks,

Ps: I will be checking in changes to this framework.
